# tuples in python


coordinates = (23.5,65.98)

# immutable you can not change tuple value
# cor[1] = 10
# gives error

# the main difference between list and tuple is when some value is not going to be modified
# then and only then use tuple otherwise use tuple
# you can modify lists of tuple in above example
